# counter_app

Based on the default/starting point Flutter Counter app.

Created a minimal Counter app, that increments and decrements the counter, you can also reset the counter to 0.

##

For this project, I deleted all the base code and started from scratch.
Created a pages folder that contains the `counter_page.dart` (`lib/pages/counter_page.dart`) file that is a StatefulWidget.
In here I created a private variable and also private methods that increment, decrement and reset the counter variable. 
This page consists of the following widgets - 

- Scaffold
- Center
- Column
- Text
- Row
- ElevatedButton

In the `main.dart` file, I pass the `CounterPage` stateful widget.

This is how the counter app looks like on start up -
